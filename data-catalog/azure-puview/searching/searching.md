# Searching

Microsoft Purview allows you to search information from the data map by using the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog.

You can perform text-based search and browse through results by using filters like data source type, tags, ratings, or collection.

You can use business context to search information from the Microsoft Purview catalog. You can define business glossaries and bulk import existing ones, too. You can also apply business context onto assets in the data map. By using a metamodel, you can define business processes in your environment and associate your data sources with those processes. Users can then apply these business contexts to browse and search for information in the data catalog.

Discovery enables you to use:

Semantic search and browse.
Business glossary and workflows.
Data lineage with sources, owners, transformations, and lifecycle.
