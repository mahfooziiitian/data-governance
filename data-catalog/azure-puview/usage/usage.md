Microsoft Purview is the right choice for your data governance and discovery needs. The criteria that indicate whether Microsoft Purview will meet your requirements are:

1. Discovery
2. Governance

## Discovery

Without a central location to register data sources, you might be unaware of a data source unless you come into contact with it as part of another process.

Unless you know the location of a data source, you can't connect to the data by using a client application. You're required to know the connection string or path.

The intended use of the data is hidden to you unless you know the location of a data source's documentation. Data sources and documentation might live in several places and be utilized through different kinds of experiences.

## Governance

As the data in your organization grows, the task of discovering, protecting, and governing that data becomes more difficult. Data is stored in different locations, which might be required for compliance reasons. The data might contain sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal information.

Compliance with company security policies, government regulations, and customer needs are critical considerations for data governance. Understanding which data sources contain sensitive information is key to knowing where protections are needed and how to guard against access to this sensitive data.
