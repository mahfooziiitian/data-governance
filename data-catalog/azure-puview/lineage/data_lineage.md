# Lineage

The concept of data lineage focuses on the lifecycle of data. The lifecycle concerns itself with the various stages data might go through. Data is sourced, moved, and stored throughout its lifecycle. Data might also undergo transformations in the extract, load, and transform/extract, transform, and load (ELT/ETL) operations.

Data lineage can offer insights into the data lifecycle by looking at the data pipeline. You can use the lineage to identify the root cause of data issues, perform data quality analysis, and verify compliance.

Microsoft Purview represents this data lineage in a visual form by showing data movement from source to destination.
