# Classification

Metadata is used to help describe the data that's being scanned and made available in the catalog. During the configuration of a scan set, you can specify classification rules to apply during the scan that also serve as metadata.

The classification rules fall under five major categories:

1. **Government:** Attributes such as government identity cards, driver license numbers, and passport numbers.
2. **Financial:** Attributes such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers.
3. **Personal:** Personal information such as a person's age, date of birth, email address, and phone number.
4. **Security:** Attributes like passwords that can be stored.
5. **Miscellaneous:** Attributes not included in the other categories.
