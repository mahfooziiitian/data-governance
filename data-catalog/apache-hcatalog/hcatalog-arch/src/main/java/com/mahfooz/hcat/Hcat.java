/*

HCatalog is a table storage management tool for Hadoop that exposes the tabular data of Hive metastore to other Hadoop applications.
It enables users with different data processing tools (Pig, MapReduce) to easily write data onto a grid.
HCatalog ensures that users donâ€™t have to worry about where or in what format their data is stored.
HCatalog is built on top of the Hive metastore and incorporates Hive's DDL.
HCatalog provides read and write interfaces for Pig and MapReduce and uses Hive's command line interface for issuing data definition and metadata exploration commands.
